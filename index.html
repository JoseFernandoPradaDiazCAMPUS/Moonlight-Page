          Red Moon in Venus is the third studio album by Colombian American singer Kali Uchis. The album was released on March 3, 2023, through EMI and Geffen Records. The album features guest appearances by Omar Apollo, Don Toliver and Summer Walker. It is predominantly an R&B record.
          Red Moon in Venus debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 and at #2 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, making it her first top 10 album on that list.
          On January 11, 2022, Uchis announced that she was putting the finishing touches on her third studio album. On April 21, 2022, she revealed to Billboard that she had two albums ready, one in English and one in Spanish. On September 2, 2022, Uchis released the "retro house" track "No Hay Ley", the first solo release in nearly two years. On December 9, 2022, she announced that she had turned in the new album, describing it as her "latest contribution to this world". She released the single "I Wish You Roses" on January 19, 2023, along with its music video. The song was produced by Dylan Wiggins and Josh Crocker.
          According to Uchis, the song is about "being able to release people with love".[10] On February 23, 2023, she released the second single for the album, "Moonlight", accompanied by a lyric video.

          The singer announced the album title three days later. Uchis revealed through her Instagram stories that many of the songs on the album were written and recorded years ago, specifying that the album was recorded during lockdown. The release date and the cover were both revealed on January 23. About the project, Uchis explained:

  Ooh, never thought I would be without you

  I was a rose in a garden of weeds
  My petals are soft and silky as my sheets
  So do not be afraid to get pricked by the thorns
  While I'm here, I'm someone to honor
  When I'm gone, I'm someone to mourn
  But if you and my heart should someday drift apart
  I'll make sure to give you these blessings because they're all I've got
  My love's deep as the ocean, don't you drown on me
  Just know, any love I gave you's forever yours to keep
  [Refrain]
  Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses
  I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses
  Ooh, I wish you roses and roses and roses and roses and roses

    [Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
    Theâ€…mirror's on my ceiling (Ha-hah-hah)
    So Iâ€…can watch you top me (Ha-hah-hah)
    Deep in my knees I got weak
    Baby, you know I'm a freak
    Wanna get naughty, nasty
    And treat you, oh, so right
    Every day and every night, I do
    (I do, I can't get rid of you)
    (Like gum stuck to my shoe)
    And don't say you got to go
    Baby, take off my clothes
    'Cause I got somethin' to show ya
    Show you the things that words cannot say
    Show you it was worth the wait
    I think you deserve a taste (A taste, a taste)
    [Chorus: Omar Apollo & Kali Uchis, Kali Uchis]
    (I wanna be around)
    I want to be around you everyday (Day-ay-ay-ay)
    This feeling in my body's not the same (Same)
    Are you still down? (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la)
    
    [Verse 2: Kali Uchis]
    Most people don't know how to love, that's why they're empty
    Nothing will ever be enough, that's why they envy
    Gotta be careful with my heart because I love deep
    Quit tellin' me you wanna put a baby in me
    If your affection for me's truly only skin-deep
    I don't wanna end up just another broken family
    (You would never do that to me, would you, baby?)
    
    [Chorus: Omar Apollo & Kali Uchis, Kali Uchis]
    (I wanna be around)
    I want to be around you everyday (Day-ay-ay-ay)

  Oh
  Ooh, oh

  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
  
  [Verse 1]
  I hate your phone, throw it away
  Wish it had never even been invented
  What if for now we just pretend the world don't exist?
  What if we never kissed?
  [Pre-Chorus]
  I guess there's just no turning back (Now)
  But I wouldn't even in a time machine
  So, go and tell everyone you know (Hah-hah-hah)
  That you're all mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
  
  [Chorus]
  All mine, that's all me
  Every time I see you smile, that's all me
  And if they thought they had a chance, I'm sorry
  But there just ain't no way in hell, that's all mine, all me
  
  [Verse 2]
  Don't gotta fight for what is mine (Now)
  You couldn't keep him even if I gave him to you
  It's just pathetic at this point
  If you think my baby'll leave me for you (Tell the world)
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Go and tell the world (Let 'em know), let all these hoes know
  Who's the only girl that can make you cry
  I wonder if it hurts how hard they try
  To take what's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
  
  [Chorus]
  All mine, that's all me
  Every time I see you smile, that's all me
  And they should go and find their own, I'm sorry
  But we won't leave each other alone
  There just ain't no way, no how
  Every time I see you smile, that's all me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
  My baby make me so proud, that's all me
  We'll figure it out as we go, just you and me (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

  Diamonds on my wrist, that's my love language (Uh-huh)
  And kisses down my back, starting from my neck
  Leaning side to side (To side), emptying my mind (My mind)
  Loyal as they come (They come), I've been down to ride
  When you feel alone-one (Yeah, yeah)
  I'll hold you down, ooh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
  I belong to you (To you), know you're all mine too (Mine too)
  Yes, we made mistakes (Mistakes), now, can we make this right?

  Hear me now
  Let the sun (Ah-ah-ah) come on down
  I feel your hand (Ah-ah), let me make it right
  I'll do it all again just to see your face
  I'm really winnin', livin' happily
  This here my fantasy
  I wanna start me a family
  Baby, tell me why you're mad at me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

  About the fact that you're still obsessed with me years later
  At the end of the day, she'd eat my pussy if I let her
  At the end of the day, she'd trade lives with me if God let her
  So, whatever makes you feel better

    One thing about karma, that bitch will find you

    You're gonna feel it, you're gonna feel it
    When you're all alone, when you're all alone
    You'll know you were wrong
    You're gonna feel it, you're gonna feel it
    When you're all alone
    [Verse 1]
    Maybe I'm just out my mind, tryna figure out this life
    I hate how good I could see right through you like Miami waters
    Lost myself a while back, tryna make peace with my past
    I guess I was just lookin' for the love no one's showed me in my childhood
    Well, I hopÐµ you feel it, I hope you find what you're looking for
    Surroundin' yourself with praisÐµ
    But the truth sets in on those nights alone
    And I can only scream all these feelings I have about it
    La-la-la-la, ooh

    Yeah, everyone's replaceable
    But not me, though
    You'll feel it deep down whenever you're alone
    You're livin' a lie if you're sayin' I'm wrong
    Hope you're at least real with yourself
    I hope you know when karma comes 'round
    Knockin' down on your door
    She's comin' to collect 'cause karma won't forget

  [Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
  Finally stopped callin'
  Tryna forget your face and put these thoughts to rest
  Can I move on? Gotta get this off my chest
  Wanna feel light as a feather, just wanna feel okay
  Is that okay?
  Back on the road
  You just had to make it harder than it already was
  Always gotta take you farther 'til you're at your worse
  Why you so petty? Now you're bitter and it shows (Eh-eh)
  Yeah, it shows
  [Chorus: Kali Uchis]
  I like it better when you're gone
  I feel a little less alone
  You know I never needed you
  Didn't deserve me, you don't deserve me
  You see the world through tired eyes
  Deep down you gotta know you're wrong (Eh-eh)
  You know I never needed you (Eh-eh)
  Didn't deserve me (Oh), you don't deserve me (No)
  You don't deserve me, no
  
  [Verse 2: Summer Walker]
  You don't deserve the love I give you
  Make me wanna take the pussy back (Back)
  You don't even know how to act (Act)
  I don't deserve the shit you put me through (Ooh-ooh)
  Like you don't know that you're lucky
  Make a cute nigga feel ugly
  Like I got time for callin' you (Callin')
  Like, "What you doin'?" (What you doin'?)
  Watchin' you (Watchin' you) like how you movin', ah
  But I think I just might fuck you one last time to be sure (Sure)
  If you walk through that door
  
  [Bridge: Kali Uchis]
  Don't come creepin' through my window
  I know that you kept your key
  Yeah, yo fui la que siempre te di de todo
  Y pa' ti eso nunca fue suficiente
  Now my love ain't what it used to be
  You just don't get it or maybe you just got used to me
  Do you know how many motherfuckers want this pussy exclusively?
  You ain't the only one tryna be the only one
  Wise up, man, 'cause you're lookin' real dumb
  
  [Chorus: Kali Uchis]
  I like it better when you're gone
  I feel a little less alone
  You know I never needed you
  Didn't deserve me (No), you don't deserve me (No)
  You see the world through tired eyes
  Deep down you gotta know you're wrong (Eh-eh)
  Deep down I always should've known (Eh-eh)
  You don't deserve me (No), didn't deserve me (No)
  You don't deserve me, no
  
  [Outro: Kali Uchis]
  You know it, you're so manipulative
  I need you to know that you're so manipulative
  You know it, first you're bitter, then you're sweet
  You think you're so discreet
  I see what you did there, what you doin' to me
  You played yourself the saddest violin
  I bet you thought I didn't see it comin'
  You had me hangin' on a string
  I let it go, let it go, let it go, now can you let go of me?
  (Let go of me, let go of me, let go of me, let go of me)
  (Let go of me, let go of me, let go of me, let go of me)

  [Chorus]
  I just wanna get high with my lover
  Veo una muÃ±eca cuando miro en el espejo
  Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
  I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
  I just wanna get high with my lover
  Veo una muÃ±eca cuando miro en el espejo
  Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
  I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
  
  [Verse 1]
  Forget the small talk
  The surface level ain't much that I care for
  Putting on my lip gloss
  I saw you stare from my peripheral, yeah
  [Pre-Chorus]
  Baby, it's been a hell of a day
  But I know a place we can escape
  Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
  When you're here with me
  
  [Chorus]
  I just wanna get high with my lover
  Veo una muÃ±eca cuando miro en el espejo
  Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
  I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
  I just wanna get high with my lover
  Veo una muÃ±eca cuando miro en el espejo
  Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
  I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
  
  [Verse 2]
  There's nothing like peace of mind
  And you take the time to make sure that I'm okay
  I know I can put stress on your brain
  (You still love me, put no one above me)
  
  [Pre-Chorus]
  You always go out of your way
  To show me that I'm your priority
  Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
  When you're here with me
  
  [Chorus]
  I just wanna get high with my lover
  Veo una muÃ±eca cuando miro en el espejo (I just wanna get high with my lover)
  Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
  I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
  I just wanna get high with my lover (Get high)
  Veo una muÃ±eca cuando miro en el espejo (High with my lover)
  Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
  I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
  
  [Outro]
  Get higher with you
  Get higher and higher with you
  Let's go to the moon
  And leave behind all that
  How does it feel, here by my side getting higher and higher?
  Under the moonlight's glow
  There's nowhere we won't go
  Together go higher and higher
  No-no-nowhere we won't go
